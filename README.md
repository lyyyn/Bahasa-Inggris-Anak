## Technologies

* **Materialize** is used for UI foundation
* **Body-parser**

## Approaches Taken
It started with the idea to create a quality site for learning Early English as apparently such site are not many. Because the material for kids are mostly for parents/teacher to read to them, eg showing from the device, I did some research on font that is suitable for learning early English for kids age 2-6 years old. the font should have the rounded a and not the one with the cap on top, also has visible separation between characters and visible top for b,d,f,h,k,l,t as well as visible/standard curved leg (not the rounded one) for g, visible curved leg for j,p,q,y. The design is simple and UI also designed to be simple and colourful to get children interest.

## Accomplishments  
* A working full-stack application, built by you, using Node.js, MongoDB, Express and EJS
* Adhere to the MVC file structure: Models, Views, Controllers
* At least one model with all 7 RESTful routes and full CRUD
* A git repository not inside the class repo.
* Be deployed online and accessible to the public via Heroku
* Use EJS Partials
* Include portfolio-quality styling
* Use a CSS framework like Materialize

## Difficulties Faced
